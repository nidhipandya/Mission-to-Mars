# Mission-to-Mars

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to learn web scraping. for that here first we are getting the data from a live [website](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) then we store that data in MongoDb, which is a local database. Now we use the stored data in our website. The (responsive)website is created using flask with python and html/css code.
