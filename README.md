# Mission-to-Mars

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to learn web scraping. for that here first we are getting the data from a [live website](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) then we store that data in MongoDb, which is a local database. Now we use this stored data for [our website](https://github.com/nidhipandya/Mission-to-Mars/tree/main/templates/index.html). The (responsive)website is created using flask with python and html/css code.
